# Versioned Go Control Plane

This repository creates versioned releases of Envoyâ€™s Go Control Plane pinned to specific Envoy versions. For each selected Go Control Plane version (e.g., v0.13.4), we generate protos from a chosen Envoy version (e.g., v1.32.3) and publish the resulting code as a combined release (v0.13.4-envoy1.32.3). This ensures that each release is tied to an exact Envoy version, making it easier to maintain stability and compatibility across different environments.
